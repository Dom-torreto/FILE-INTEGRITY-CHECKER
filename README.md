*DISCRIPTION*: The File Integrity Checker is a command-line tool that verifies whether two files are exactly the same by comparing their SHA-256 hash values. Hashing is a process where data is passed through an algorithm to produce a fixed-size string, called a hash. This hash acts like a digital fingerprint: if the file changes even slightly, the hash changes completely. By comparing hash values, we can confirm whether a file has stayed the same or has been modified.The project is developed using Python’s built-in hashlib module, which supports various secure hash functions. For this tool, SHA-256 was chosen due to its strong cryptographic properties and common use in verifying data integrity. The script works by prompting the user to enter the paths of two files. It then reads each file in binary mode, calculates the SHA-256 hash of their contents, and displays both hash values. After that, the tool compares the hashes and informs the user whether the files are identical or different.This tool is simple but has powerful use cases. For instance, if you're a system administrator or IT professional, it can be used to monitor important configuration files for unauthorized changes. If you're a developer, it can ensure that files shared between machines or team members haven't been corrupted or edited unintentionally. Even for everyday users, it provides a way to verify downloaded files or backups without needing advanced software.What makes this tool particularly useful is its ease of use and portability. It doesn’t require any third-party libraries or external tools. It runs on any system where Python is installed and can be used in just a few steps. It’s lightweight, efficient, and does not modify the original files in any way.Beyond practical use, this project also serves as a learning experience in both Python programming and basic cybersecurity principles. It demonstrates how hashing algorithms work in real-world scenarios and gives insight into how systems maintain data integrity in professional settings.

In conclusion, the File Integrity Checker is a simple yet effective Python-based solution to verify whether files have been altered. By using cryptographic hashes, it helps users detect even the smallest changes in their data. This project highlights how straightforward programming concepts can be used to build meaningful tools that enhance digital trust and data protection in our everyday lives.
